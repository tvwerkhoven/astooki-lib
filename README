## Tomo-dat: wide-field wavefront sensor tomographic data processing.
## $Id:

This set of scripts takes wide-field wavefront sensor measurements as input
and aims to tomographically analyze the atmospheric seeing that disturbed
the incoming light.

TODO:
 - look into sapos/sapospix, unify variable naming
 - look into position: use origin or centroid position?
 - look into x,y problem, use (x,y) for positions or not? problem with slicing
